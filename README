Bliss Initramfs - v7.1.3

Designed for Gentoo Linux

Description
==============
This script generates an initramfs image with all the included files and
dependencies needed to mount your filesystem.

It was designed primarily to be a simple alternative to genkernel
for booting Gentoo Linux on Native ZFS (Not FUSE), but it supports a few
other combinations such as LUKS, ZFS on LUKS, RAID, and LVM.

All you need to do is run "./mkinitrd", select the options you want "a-la-carte",
and then tell the initramfs via your bootloader parameters in what order you
want those features to be trigerred in. Check the USAGE file for examples.

- dev-lang/python 3.3 or greater
